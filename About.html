                This app is designed for geeks and nerds around the world, as it speaks in the language of math. 
                Snaptext Beta consists of a visual text-reader, designed to recognize common mathematical symbols and numbers. 
                Ideally, it will read full mathematical expressions and equations, from basic algebra to complex 
                integrals or partial differential equations. It will then export this information to Wolfram Alpha, 
                an online, computational program. Lastly, it will return this data to the user, providing a simple 
                answer and possible links to Wolfram Alpha's page for further explanation, if necessary. It will be 
                very user-friendly, so that even the non-techy person can use it. Please buy our app. It is worth it.
